        We are dedicated to the makers, the creators, the risk-takers. We wake
        up in the middle of the night and furiously write down ideas about how
        to make your online life better.

        When we're not hard at work, we're hard at play - we're the loud ones in
        in the bar, and we're always the ones shutting the place down. Human communication
        and collaboration is what drives us, and it infuses every feature of gCamp.
